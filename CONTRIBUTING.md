# Contributing

> [!NOTE]
> To host the website locally, it is first required to install npm and nodejs. It is also recommended to have git installed in order to collaborate on the project.

## Editing individual pages:

The website runs on react, meaning the different pages are located in seperate .js files (e.g `Wiki.js`, `Home.js`). To edit the individual pages, edit these files (located in `site/src/Components`.

The different style (css) files are located next to the .js files in `site/src/Components`. Edit these to edit the style of the pages.

## Editing the README / TODO:

The README and TODO are both located at `docs/`. Please edit these files and not `README.md` in the root directory. The `[TODO.md]` in `docs/README.md` includes the contents of TODO.md into the README.

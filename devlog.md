# Devlog

## September 8th 2025
Today we made the repo and installed the basic React framework to the repo.
We also made the basic page of the WIKI, ignoring JS for now and focusing on HTML & CSS
We decided to go with a minimal style for the wiki, because this will guide the students using this WIKI to focus on the content, rather than the fancy styles.

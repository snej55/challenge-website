            <ul>
                <li>We are expected to wear grey trousers, or grey shorts during the warm times of year.</li>
                <li>White shirts, short or long sleeve, are allowed, but no polo shirts.</li>
                <li>The school jumper (the only one allowed) is a grey v-neck, and bears the school logo on the front.</li>
                <li>Shoes are required to be solid black, no coloured insignia or logos, but other than that there are no restrictions.</li>
                <li>Non-uniform days are relatively frequent, usually to raise money for charity, and allow everyone to enjoy themselves. Have fun!</li>

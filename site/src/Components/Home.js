            <h2>Welcome to the Wiki</h2><br />
            This wiki is a non-profit community project, launched by 5 year 11s who wanted to make things easier for others.<br/>
            Like you, we once started at this school, and felt confused by the bustling hive of activity and learning.<br/>
            But you don't have to! Because now, this wiki is here to help.<br/>
            Packed with games, flashcards, and an exhaustive amount of info on every school related subject you could name, we're here to assist in any way we can.<br/>
            We've poured our heart and soul into this webpage, and would love to see it help. Have fun!<br/>

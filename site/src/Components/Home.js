            This wiki is a non-profit community project, launched by 5 year 11s who wanted to make things easier for others.<br/>
            Like you, we once started at this school, and felt confused by the bustling hive of activity and learning<br/>
            But now, you don't have to! Because this wiki is here to help.<br/>

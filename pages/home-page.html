        <h2>Why was this WIKI Made?</h2>

        <!-- Spacer -->
        <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">This page was made by five Year 11 CAST students. We realised that many students
            new to our school were not
            able to find their way around the school easily, which leaded to the teachers needing to spend days teaching
            them how to do basic things, like where is the water fountain, or how to submit homework.</p>
        <p>Because of this, we decided that a WIKI about the school should be made. The objective of the guide is to
            make students' everyday life around the school smoother and easier. </p>
